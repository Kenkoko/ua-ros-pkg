phidgets package
Arizona Robotics Research Group (ARRG)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First Time Installation:

-- To setup USB devices for phidgets, you will need root to copy the 
   phidgets.rules file located in the phidgetspp_c_api package 
   to /etc/udev/rules.d

   Instructions are different for older kernels. Please read the README located 
   here: 

   foote-ros-pkg-read-only/phidgets/phidgetspp_c_api/build/Phidgetlinux


Software Dependencies

-- Our phidgets package uses the PhidgetsPython API (ros package name is 
   phidgets_py_api) from Phidgets, Inc. The phidgets_py_api pkg must load the 
   phidgets C driver library. Once compiled, the C library is located here: 

   foote-ros-pkg-read-only/phidgets/phidgetspp_c_api/lib/libphidget21.so


Runtime Instructions

-- The LD_LIBRARY_PATH will be set for you in the launch file. To run 
   phidgets code directly from the commandline your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set
   before running python.

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
    ~/ros/pkgs/foote-ros-pkg-read-only/phidgets/phidgetspp_c_api/lib/libphidget21.so
