  <description brief="Python AX-12 Driver Manager and control script">
  This package contains a configurable driver manager node (manager.py) 
  which can dynamically load one or more robot controllers 
  (aka, driver plugins). Plugin Controllers are written to a specific 
  driver manager interface, and they control Robotis Dynamixel AX-12+ servos. 
  A driver control script provides calls to start, stop and restart a 
  controller. This design is very similar to the experimental C++ nodelet.
