    <description brief="Python drivers for Robotis Dynamixel servos">
        This package provides low level IO for Robotis Dynamixel servos. 
        Fully supports and was tested with AX-12+, RX-28, RX-64, EX-106+ models.
        Hardware specific constants and MotorState messages are defined for 
        reading and writing information from/to the AX-12+ servos. This low 
        level package won't be used directly by most users. The higher 
        level ax12_controller_core and specific robot controllers use this 
        package.
