On OS X, depending on phidgets_py_api which loads phidgetspp_c library won't 
work! For the C API, we pull a linux tarball and compile on Ubuntu. 

You must do the following:

1. Download and install the Mac version of this library:

Mac OS X, Phidget 21 Installer 
http://www.phidgets.com/drivers.php

2. Download and install the python bindings
http://www.phidgets.com/downloads/libraries/PhidgetsPython_2.1.6.20100129.zip

3. Make sure the python bindings are on your PYTHONPATH.

4. Comment out the dependency on phidgets_py_api in phidgets_ros/manifest.xml.
Execute rosmake and the Phidgets code should work now.
