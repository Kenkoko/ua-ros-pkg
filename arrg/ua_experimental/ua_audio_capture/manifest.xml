  <description brief="a simple audio capture node which streams raw audio">

This package grabs a live audio stream from PortAudio and ships it across the
ROS botnet. The program grabs the "default" audio stream. I can't speak for
other distros, but on Ubuntu the default stream is settable via the GNOME
"System->Preferences->Sound" box. I set the "Sound Capture" field to "ALSA" and
use "alsamixer" on the command line to poke around until I get the microphone
jack working. Each motherboard seems to be a little different in how the
various jacks come up in ALSA.

In XFCE (xubuntu), I couldn't find it in the GUI, but either right-click the
speaker icon in the taskbar, or type "gnome-volume-control" in the console. 
This will bring up a handy window which lets you select the input device and
set the volume.

I assume there is a way to do this all on headless boxen, but I haven't tried.
If someone is sufficiently motivated to figure it out, let me know.
