  <description brief="Controllers for the Wubble Robot">
  This stack contains higher level controllers for the Wubble Robot, which 
  generally depend on packages in the ua_drivers stack for interfacing with 
  the hardware. Thus, packages in this stack provide a higher level of 
  abstraction for Wubble Robot subsystems than ua_drivers.
