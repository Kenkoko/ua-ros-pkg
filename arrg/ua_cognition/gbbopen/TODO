This is just a first stab, there are some issues because gbbopen uses a highly-customized asd file

Need to append the append.asd to the gbbopen.asd file (via patch mechanism?)
Also, there are currently issues with the gbbopen.asd file (seems to be in the middle of some changes)
Need to test whether ros packages depending on "gbbopen/gbbopen" can actually use the functions (seems to work in the REPL, but that's a bit different)
