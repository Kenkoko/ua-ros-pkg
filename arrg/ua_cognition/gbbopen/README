For optimal use, create a file called

.sbclrc

in your home directory, and place the equivalent of the following lines in it:

(require :asdf)
(push #P"/path/to/roslisp/asdf/" asdf:*central-registry*)
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :ros-load-manifest)  
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op "roslisp")

Where you replace "/path/to/roslisp/" with the path to your roslisp package.
You can get this by "roscd roslisp" and then "pwd". To load GBBopen from 
the lisp REPL type:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op "gbbopen/gbbopen")

After this, you can proceed with (for example) the GBBopen tutorials. The
command:

:gbbopen-user

should work as described in the GBBopen documentation.
